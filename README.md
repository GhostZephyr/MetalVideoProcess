# MetalVideoProcess
MetalVideoProcess is a High-Performance video effects processing framework. It's base on GPUImage3  & Cabbage with AVFoundation, support asynchronous and multithread processing.

## Technical requirements

- Swift 5.0

- Xcode 10.2 or higher on Mac or iOS

- iOS: 11.0 or higher

- OSX: 10.11 or higher

  

## Features

- Realtime smooth playback with filters
- Support two video transitions
- Support video motions
- Video picture in picture
- Transform video with multitouch
- Support export video with H.265
- Support video split, delete, insert, merge
- High performance metal rendering



## General architecture

MetalVideoProcess is built on  GPUImage3 & Cabbage. We extend the rendering pipeline in gpuimage3 to adapt the rendering output of one to many targets, so as to realize the rendering of multiple video clips.

## Getting Started

Compile& import Framework

```swift
import MetalVideoProcess
```



## How to use

```swift
let asset1 = AVAsset(url: Bundle.main.url(forResource: "test", withExtension: "mp4")!)
let item1 = MetalVideoEditorItem(asset: asset1)

do {
    let editor = try MetalVideoEditor(videoItems: [item1])
    let playerItem = editor.buildPlayerItem()
    let player = try MetalVideoProcessPlayer(playerItem: playerItem)

    let beautyFilter1 = MetalVideoProcessBeautyFilter()
    player -- > beautyFilter1 --> renderView
    self.player = player
    self.player?.playerDelegate = self
} catch {
	debugPrint("init error")
}
```
